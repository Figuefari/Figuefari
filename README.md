<h2 align="center">Hi! 🙂👋, I'm an engineer who is growing in the world of data analysis📈</h2>

- 🌱 I’m currently discovering and learning new tools that allow me to present data clearly and effectively.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in practicing and improving my skills in data science through projects from various areas. I am more than willing to spend hours and hours if the project involves data from the videogames or films industry 🎮🎦

- I'm from Viña del Mar🌅, a beautiful coastal city in Chile 🇨🇱
  
- 📫 How to reach me: **figuefari@gmail.com**

- ⚡ Fun fact: While I have a background as an engineer in business administration, I have been closely connected to computers since childhood. At a young age, I assembled computers and spent time learning various things on internet forums. My first data analyses were done in games like Pokemon Red, where I created Excel templates to estimate the probability of Pokemon appearances by hour and area.
